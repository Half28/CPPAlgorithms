# CodeForcesSolutions
Simple algorithms made in C++ that are the basis of interview questions and more complex theory. These are not for absolute efficiency (thus there will not be any
"cin.tie()" or "sync_with_stdio" statements), just for basic implementation. If you want to optimize them, you are welcome to do so.
